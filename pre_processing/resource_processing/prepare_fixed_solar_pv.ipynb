    "# Overview\n",
    "This notebook compares the predicted solar PV generation profiles at each existing REIPPPP site.\n",
    "The aggregated fleet production is then validated against actual Eskom data from https://www.eskom.co.za/dataportal/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar resource data is sourced from:\n",
    " - ERA5\n",
    "   - ERA5 data can be downloaded through the Copernicus Climate Data Store cdsapi package, and requires \n",
    "registration and setup as per https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to. (See notebook prepare_atlite_cutouts.ipynb)\n",
    " - SARAH \n",
    "   - SARAH data can be downloaded via from EUMETSAT CMSAF using the portal https://wui.cmsaf.eu/safira/action/viewProduktSearch\n",
    "Surface Incoming Direct Radiation (SID), Surface Incoming Shortwave Radiation (SIS) and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) should be downloaded\n",
    "and extracted into the sarah_dir path. (See notebook prepare_atlite_cutouts.ipynb)\n",
    "- NREL NSRDB\n",
    "   - The NREL National Solar Resource Database (NSRDB) can be accessed through either a range of options\n",
    "      - Via developer API (see https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/)\n",
    "      - Through System Advisor Model (SAM) software\n",
    "      - Via the NREL Highly Scalable Data Service (see https://github.com/NREL/hsds-examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The NSRDB data used in this notebook was accessed through SAM. A series (lat,lon) points were generated at the center of each ERA5 grid cell\n",
    "and then imported into SAM. The csv file for the ERA5 grid points can be found under XXX\n",
    "\n",
    "- CSIR and Fraunhofer Solar Wind Aggregation Study for South Africa\n",
    "\n",
    "Recreating data using atlite and ERA5 is simpler than using atlite with SARAH or using NSRDB. Both python libraries include PV models for fixed and tracking configuorations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw solar resource data is converted into power generation profiles using 2 python libraries.\n",
    "- Atlite (see https://atlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
